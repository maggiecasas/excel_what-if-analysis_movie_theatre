# Movie Theatre Sales — What-If Analysis Project

This project analyzes how different pricing, cost, and sales volume decisions impact the financial performance of a movie theater. The model uses Excel’s advanced What-If Analysis tools to assess revenue and profitability under multiple scenarios.

---

## Project Objective
Build a dynamic financial model that evaluates how Total Sales and Net Profit respond to changes in ticket demand, online pricing strategies, and transaction fees.

---

## 1. One-Variable Data Table

A one-variable data table was created to examine how changes in **Box-Office Tickets Sold** affect:

- Total Sales  
- Net Profit  

Ticket volume ranges from **30,000 to 65,000** in increments of **5,000**.

**Demonstrated capability:** Sensitivity analysis based on a single operational input.

---

## 2. Two-Variable Data Table

A two-variable data table evaluates how **Net Profit** changes based on:

- Online Ticket Price (8.00 to 11.50, step 0.50)  
- Credit Card Processing Fee per transaction (0.75 to 1.80, step 0.15)

**Demonstrated capability:** Multi-dimensional sensitivity analysis for pricing and cost decisions.

---

## 3. Conditional Formatting

Conditional formatting was applied to highlight all **Net Profit** values that meet or exceed a defined profitability target. This creates a clear visual reference for evaluating financial outcomes.

**Demonstrated capability:** Visual performance monitoring.

---

## 4. Scenario Manager

Three strategic scenarios were developed to analyze profitability under different conditions:

- Best Case  
- Base Case  
- Worst Case  

A full Scenario Summary was generated to compare outcomes.

**Demonstrated capability:** Structured scenario planning for decision-making.

---

## 5. Goal Seek

Goal Seek was used to determine the number of **Box-Office Tickets Sold** required for Net Profit to reach **1,200,000**.

**Demonstrated capability:** Reverse financial modeling to achieve a target outcome.
